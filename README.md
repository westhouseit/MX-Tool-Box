MX-Tool-Box
===========

UPDATE: Max's repo has reappeared! https://github.com/MaxLazar/mx_tool_box
Since it appears to contain everything in this one plus at least one fix, I encourage you to download from his instead. If it ever disappears again you can find my new fork @ https://github.com/westhouseit/mx_tool_box

Version: 1.2.1


This ExpressionEngine addon seems to have disappeared, perhaps due to lack of time to support it. Since it's on the MIT license I'm releasing it here for all to use.


The MX Tool Box is a suite of light developerâ€™s tools which can make your work with EE a litte bit easier or/and faster. At this moment the box has tools for cloning/ordering/export/import fields.

Many thanks to the original developer: Max Lazar http://www.eec.ms/
